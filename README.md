# Data-Driven Player Selection for the Singapore National Football Team: Leveraging Club-Level Performance Analytics

### Background

Football is the most popular sport globally, capturing the hearts of millions. In the realm of football analytics, data has become an indispensable tool for improving team performance, scouting new talent, and making strategic decisions. Traditionally, national team selection has been based on subjective judgments by coaches and selectors. However, with the advent of advanced data analytics, there is a significant opportunity to make this process more objective and data-driven.

In Singapore, football is a beloved sport, but the national team's performance can benefit from more sophisticated selection methods. By leveraging club-level statistics, we can enhance the selection process for the national team, ensuring that the best players are chosen based on their performance metrics. This approach aligns with the global trend of data-driven decision-making in sports.

### Problem Statement

The traditional process of selecting players for the Singapore national football team relies heavily on the subjective judgment of coaches and selectors. While experience and intuition play crucial roles, this method can lead to biases and overlooked talents. Additionally, the lack of comprehensive and accessible data for local leagues hampers the ability to make informed decisions.

This project aims to address these issues by developing a data-driven approach to player selection for the Singapore national football team. By analyzing in-depth club statistics, including goals, assists, passes, distance covered, and other performance metrics, we can create a more objective and transparent selection process. This approach not only helps in identifying the best players for specific roles and formations but also ensures that the selection process is based on empirical evidence rather than subjective opinions.

### Objectives

1. **Data Collection and Integration**: Gather comprehensive football statistics from reliable sources, such as SofaScore, for Singaporean football clubs.
2. **Performance Analysis**: Analyze players' performance data to identify key metrics that are indicative of success in various positions and roles.

By following this approach, the project aims to create a robust, data-driven model that enhances the player selection process for the Singapore national football team, ensuring that the best players are chosen for their specific roles and formations based on objective performance metrics.



### 1. Define Specific Roles
For each position, define the specific roles and the unique attributes required for each. For example:

**Midfielders**:
- **Box-to-Box Midfielder**: Stamina, tackles, interceptions, passing, dribbling, goals.
- **Deep-Lying Playmaker**: Passing accuracy, vision, long passes, defensive contributions.
- **Ball-Winning Midfielder**: Tackles, interceptions, work rate, stamina.

**Defenders**:
- **Ball-Playing Defender**: Passing accuracy, interceptions, tackles, vision.
- **No-Nonsense Defender**: Clearances, aerial duels, tackles, positioning.

**Forwards**:
- **Poacher**: Goals, shots on target, positioning, pace.
- **Target Man**: Aerial duels, hold-up play, goals, strength.

### 2. Collect and Preprocess Data
Collect data relevant to these specific roles. Ensure you gather both general and role-specific statistics:
- **General Attributes**: Goals, assists, tackles, interceptions, passing accuracy.
- **Role-Specific Attributes**: Long passes for a deep-lying playmaker, aerial duels for a target man.

### 3. Role Suitability Analysis
Develop a scoring system to evaluate how well a player fits into a specific role:
- **Attribute Weights**: Assign different weights to attributes based on their importance for each role.
- **Composite Scores**: Calculate a composite score for each player for each role.

### 4. Advanced Role Suitability Analysis
Use advanced techniques to further refine your role suitability analysis:
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduce dimensionality and identify the most important features for each role.
- **Clustering**: Group similar players together based on their attributes to identify natural fits for specific roles.

### 5. Machine Learning Models
Train machine learning models to predict role suitability:
- **Training Data**: Use historical data of players who have successfully played in specific roles.
- **Models**: Experiment with models like Random Forests, SVMs, or Neural Networks.

### Example Workflow

#### Define Roles and Attributes
```python
roles = {
    'Box-to-Box Midfielder': {'Stamina': 0.2, 'Tackles': 0.2, 'Interceptions': 0.15, 'Passing': 0.15, 'Dribbling': 0.1, 'Goals': 0.2},

```python
def calculate_role_score(player, role_attributes):
    return sum(player[attr] * weight for attr, weight in role_attributes.items())

# Example player data
player = {'Stamina': 85, 'Tackles': 90, 'Interceptions': 75, 'Passing': 80, 'Dribbling': 70, 'Goals': 10}
role_scores = {role: calculate_role_score(player, attributes) for role, attributes in roles.items()}
print(role_scores)
```

#### Machine Learning Model
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Sample dataset
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Stamina': [85, 70, 65, 90, 80],

    'Dribbling': [70, 80, 75, 65, 90],
    'Goals': [10, 5, 15, 8, 12],
    'Role': ['Box-to-Box Midfielder', 'Deep-Lying Playmaker', 'Ball-Winning Midfielder', 'Box-to-Box Midfielder', 'Deep-Lying Playmaker']
})

# Encode roles
data['Role'] = data['Role'].astype('category').cat.codes

# Train-test split
X = data.drop('Role', axis=1)
y = data['Role']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

### Visualization
Create detailed visualizations to present player suitability for specific roles:
- **Radar Charts**: Compare player attributes for different roles.
- **Heatmaps**: Show suitability scores for multiple players and roles.
- **Role Matchup**: Display the best players for each role in the selected formation.

### Conclusion
By incorporating specific roles within positions, you can provide a more nuanced analysis and make better-informed recommendations for player selection. This approach leverages detailed attribute data and advanced analytics to match players to specific tactical requirements.
